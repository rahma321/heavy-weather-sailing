## Using Historypin to link past to present

I've biked to work since last century. To me, cycling is freedom. It is also clean and it keeps you fit.

When I worked for Auckland Libraries, I made a Historypin collection called [Bicycling Auckland](https://www.historypin.org/en/bicycling-auckland/geo/-36.900608,174.807884,12/bounds/-37.012541,174.710662,-36.78851,174.905106/paging/1/project/about). This is a collection of photographs from the Auckland Libraries online collections on the topic of cycling in Auckland. I traced the location of each photograph and pinned them to a map of Auckland. It is possible to see archived view overlaid on the present-day location in some of the images, such as this one taken at Three Lamps in Ponsonby:

The idea behind Historypin is great but to be honest, I don't find it easy to use or navigate.
