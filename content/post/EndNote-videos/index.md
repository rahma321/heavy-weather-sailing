## Honing our process  

These were not the first instructional videos we made after I started in my current role at AUT. But with these videos we really honed the process and became more confident in working togther, including giving feedback on each others' work, and in using the software for screencasting and editing.
The work and research done by Learning Advisors helped inform our process, especially the summary of Mayer (2017) (see next post). Here are my notes on the learning.

1. Planning roles. In this project it became evident that a core group of 3-4 people with times and skills was all that was needed. These people understand and can apply Meyer's principles (2015
2. Writing scripts. While a large group worked on the initial scripting, this was very inefficient and slow. People got bogged down in detail, were overly verbous, and added tangential information.
3. Feedback processes. We recognised the need to get feedback early. This was sometimes useful but sometimes it had the effect of stalling us. We learned to consider feedback but we would not always follow it.
4. Recording audio. These videos used the voice of Alex Baldwin and we recorded her in a studio in WB. This made for great sound, but also meant booking both Alex and the studio ahead of time. It also made it tricky later to edit segments of the videos.
5. Using images. Parts of the videos were attempting to illustrate concepts and we spent a long time working our how best to illustrate these. We ended up using simple icons and in one place, a photograph.
6. Screencasting. The mechanics of screencasting took practice and we became more adept. We used Screencast-o-matic software with a 10-user Liscence. We had issues with losing files and worked out that each log on was unique to the person using it, so the SOM files had to be shared by memory stick before we had Sharepoint.
7. Editing, styles, colours, fonts. WE were expereimenting with effects and consistency when editing. WE made a palette for the videos and were careful with callouts, use of highlights and zoom effects. As time went on, we became more confident with these.
8. Accessibility. Screencast-o-matic does subtitles well. We used the scripted recording function, so the subtitles went in easily. We did not use music in the EndNote videos.
9. Admin. Every video has a folder (now on Sharepoint) that includes script, PowerPoint, audio files, SOM file and MP4 file. While this might seem obvious to a professional videographer, we learned this by trial and error!

Here is an example of one of these videos. They are no longer in use due to EndNote now being upgraded. Another learning - that making instructional videos for software is not the best use of our time.
