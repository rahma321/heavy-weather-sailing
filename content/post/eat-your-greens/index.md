## Eat your greens!!

In a presentation at the Association of Tertiary Learning Advisors Aotearoa New Zealand Conference 2018, AUT Library Learning Advisors presented an engaging summary of hints for writing instructional videos [(Macnaught, L., Bassett, M. & Margetts, K. 2018)](https://academics.aut.ac.nz/lucy.macnaught/publications). This was based upon Mayer's principles (Mayer, 2017).

Here are these guidelines. You may agree or disagree with some, and indeed there are times when you may not follow these as *rules*. But they do help with keeping on topic, to-the-point and clear.

So, in your script, notice the following and decide whether they are really needed. If they are not, then trim. 

### 1. Google maps
- Time and place contextualising:  
E.g. “At uni you will need…” 

### 2. Eat your greens
- A directive tone:   
E.g. “You should….”  
E.g. “Use ….” 

### 3. Run ups and previews  
- Unnecessary opening or closing words   
E.g. “Here’s an example….”    
E.g. “Let’s start….”     
E.g. “Later we will…”   

### 4. Here we go agains 
- Repetitions 
- Empty soundbites 
- General statements which frontload about value   
E.g. “visual representations can help you process complex ideas”   
Instead, go straight to the function and demonstrate specific tools 

### 5. Distant relatives 
- things that are related, but not directly on topic  
E.g. explaining peer reviewed journals in a video about paraphrasing   
Instead, do videos in a playlist (cluster related topics together)    
Have video *end screen* directing to recommened videos
