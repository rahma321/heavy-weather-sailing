## The Colenso Bibliography

[The Colenso Project](http://colensoandtherepublicofletters.weebly.com/about.html) was a collaboration between The Colenso Society, Victoria University of Wellington and MTG Hawkes Bay. I worked on the Colenso Project as Summer Scholar with Dr Sydney Shep (Victoria University of Wellington) in 2012 - 2013. I also had the honour of photographing original letters to William Colenso that were collected by Christopher Parr.

We searched archives in New Zealand and overseas for letters written by William Colenso, who was a prodigious writer of personal letters, letters to newpapers and pamphlets, and more. My job was to collect these records into a [Zotero bibliography](https://www.zotero.org/groups/62194/colenso/library). Later I made a poster summarising the work.

## Colenso's Correspondents

In a later development of the project (2014-2015) I traced the archival collections of the people Colenso wrote to, many who were eminent scientists, well-known clergy, businesmen and prominent Māori. I became fascinated with the [faces and the lives](https://www.pinterest.nz/rehma2/colensos-correspondents/) of the times. 
  
An example of this is how people communicated. The boat that called to Ahuriri (Napier) was the main connection to Wellington, and often Colenso would be hurrying to finish letters to catch the boat before it left.  

He did dream of a time when things might be different. Amazingly, this seems to predict the Internet:

> Would we could converse by electricity, or telegraph (spiritual or mental); a **future** generation may do this.
