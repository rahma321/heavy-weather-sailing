## The Colenso Bibliography

[The Colenso Project](http://colensoandtherepublicofletters.weebly.com/about.html) was a collaboration between The Colenso Society, Victoria University of Wellington and MTG Hawkes Bay.

We searched archives in New Zealand and overseas for letters written by William Colenso, who was a prodigious writer, both of personal letters, letters to newpapers and pamphlets. I collected these records into a [Zotero bibliography](https://www.zotero.org/groups/62194/colenso/library).I made a poster summarising the work.
