## Sailing around Cape Horn 1996

Every 30-40 minutes, a squall of around 50 knots would come through. We reefed down hard each time, leaving only a strip of mainsail to keep underway, and letting the reefs out when the squall passed. The Cape was visible about 2 kms aways, through a haze of spray. Squalls brought big rolling seas, that swamped the lower deck of the boat.

After my watch I went below, where the bosun Hanno was dispensing shots of rum and piercing ears. This is traditional for rounding Cape Horn. As medic I decided I'd best provide some assistance.

This is a once-in-a-lifetime expereince that I'll never forget. But sailing is significant to me for another reason. It was while at sea I realised navigation uses the mathematics I'd learned at school and at uni - cosines, tangents, vectors. All of which I'd previously thought useless. My desire to see abstract learning surfaced as real and useful in the world started with this very real application. 

I also became aware of technology for communications and navigation. This was the time of early mobile devices, email and satellite phones in suitcases. Larger boats had radar and GPS plotters; some smaller yachts carried handheld GPS. They were only switched on to plot a position and while amazingly easy compared to using a sextant, were not always very accurate .
