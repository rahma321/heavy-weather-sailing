## The weather

...was typical of Cape Horn I am told. Every 30-40 minutes, a squall of around 50 knots would come through. We reefed down hard each time , leaving only a strip of mainsail to keep underway, and letting the reefs out when the squall passed. The Cape was visible about 2 kms aways, through a haze of spray.

Squalls brought big rolling seas, that swamped the lower deck of the boat.

After my watch I went below, where the bosun Hanno was dispensing shots of rum and piercing ears. This is traditional for rounding Cape Horn. As medic I decided I'd best provide some assistance.
